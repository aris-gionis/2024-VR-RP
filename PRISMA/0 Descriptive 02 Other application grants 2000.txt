I currently have no ongoing grant from the Swedish Research Council.

I recently applied to a distinguished professor grant in natural and engineering sciences 2024, in the call closed on March 5, 2024. I understand that one can apply to both of these grants simultaneously (distringuished professor grant and project grant), and choose one if both are funded.

The current proposal is a new direction in my research agenda and is not related to any of my ongoing grants.

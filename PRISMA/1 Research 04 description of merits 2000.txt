The qualification that better reflects the potential to implement successfully the proposed research, in my view, is my extensive publication record and emphasis on high-quality research outputs. I believe that this demonstrates best my ability to select important research topics to work on, my depth of knowledge in computational methods, and my aptitude to pursue sound and rigorous approaches. 

Second, I have extensive expertise on managing research projects, including four projects from the Academy of Finland, two European Research-and-Infrastructure projects, my ERC Advanced Grant, and the funding provided via my WASP chair position. I believe that this experience has equipped me with the necessary skills to recruit high-achieving doctoral students and postdocs, and to inspire and motivate them to reach the best of their potential and achieve their goals.

Last, I am very actively engaged in the endeavors of my scientific community, as an editorial-board member in high-impact journals, as well as PC member and PC co-chair in major events. I pursue collaborations with my international network, and I travel for research visits, conferences, and invited seminars. I believe that such active participation will benefit the members of my team by exposing them to the latest research ideas and giving them diverse perspectives. It will also provide networking opportunities and will inspire academic and professional growth.

\item[{1.}]
{L.\ Oettershagen, H.\ Wang, \textbf{A.\ Gionis}},
{\em ``Finding densest subgraphs with edge-color constraints''},
to appear in the ACM Web Conference (WebConf) 2024
%
\item[]
We study a variant of the \emph{densest subgraph problem}, 
where we consider constraints on the types of edges in the solution subgraph.
The edge types provide an explainable description of the discovered dense subgraph.
The PI contributed to the conception of the idea, 
design of methods, mathematical proofs, supervision of doctoral students and postdocs, and paper writing.

{G.\ Zhang, \textbf{A.\ Gionis}},
{\em ``Regularized impurity reduction: Accurate decision trees with complexity guarantees''},
Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery (DMKD), 
volume 37, number 1, 2023
%
\item[]
We propose a method for interpretable classification by finding decision trees
whose size complexity is within a logarithmic factor of the optimal tree.
Our setting incorporates a general family of impurity functions, 
which include the popular entropy and Gini-index functions.
The PI contributed to the conception of the idea, 
design of methods, supervision of the doctoral student, and paper writing.

{\em ``Concise and interpretable multi-label rule sets''}, 
Knowledge and Information Systems (KAIS),
volume 65, number 12, 2023
%
\item[]
We develop a multi-label classifier that can be represented as a concise set of simple ``if-then'' rules, 
and thus, offers better interpretability compared to black-box models. 
Our method is able to find a small set of relevant patterns that lead to accurate multi-label classification.
The PI contributed to the conception of the idea, 
design of methods, supervision of the doctoral students, and paper writing.

{\em ``A constant-factor approximation algorithm for reconciliation $k$-median''}, 
26th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS) 2023
%
\item[]
We design a new algorithm for the \emph{reconciliation $k$-median problem} 
that yields a constant-factor approximation. 
The problem aims to find a set of cluster centers that are not too far from each other. 
The algorithm leverages a close connection of reconciliation $k$-median to a variant 
of $k$-facility location.
The PI contributed to the conception of the idea, 
design of methods, supervision of the doctoral students and postdocs, and paper writing.

{\em ``Diversity-aware $k$-median: Clustering with fair center representation''},
European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery (ECML PKDD) 2021 
%
\item[]
We introduce a novel problem for diversity-aware clustering. 
We assume that cluster centers belong to different groups, 
and we ask to find a minimum-cost clustering so that 
a minimum number of cluster centers are chosen from each group. 
The PI contributed to the conception of the idea, 
design of methods, mathematical proofs, supervision of doctoral students and postdocs, and paper writing.
